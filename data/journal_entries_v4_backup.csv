I was searching but gave up long ago. It’s not very realistic to pursue those.” Consulting is a sunsetting industry. All the possibilities are open for him - promotion, layoff. Everything is uncertain.

I feel like a lot of us spend too much time on what we think we should do. We don’t spend time on learning about what we are good at or enjoy. This increases the likelihood of experiencing repeated failures, then losing the conviction that we can achieve something.

It is important that we give ourselves the chance to learn about what we already enjoy and are good at. From this, we expand the circle of competency (self-efficacy → self-esteem). This does not mean that we go all in on our strengths. The idea is that we have a certain level of confidence and conviction in ourselves, which helps when working to improve our weaknesses (what we should do).

Meeting Alex and starting martial arts was this kind of moment in my life. I learned how to stretch my ability in this way, and from that, I got more confidence. Martial arts state of mind. I would love to share with others. Learn to be okay with confrontation. Being okay with pressure.

I thought didn’t like sparring because I think aggression/violence is bad. But once I start winning, I like sparring.  Nietzsche’s take on ‘truth’ is in fact will to power. that I made moral attribution. but in fact it was because I wasn’t good at it. When I become good at it, I like it. When I am not good at it, I don’t like it. in the end, it was my own rationalization to feel good about myself (state of being - when I am bad at it, I can just say aggression is bad).

you want it because you think it is a good idea. not good. Everybody can come with 100 reasons why they are correct. No one can come up with reason why they are wrong about it. Because it’s  blind spot.

I am afraid of other people judging me. I amnot as good as I thought they were. I wanted to live up to the expectation or the perception that other people hold about me.

What hurt me the most is that I interpret their concern as mistrusting my ability or undermining my capability. I know it is just a career, but I don’t want to go home feeling meaningless. But also, at the end of the day, it is just work. I want to go back home, where my family is. I am not chasing glories and money.
